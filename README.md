# alx_capstone_project


## Project Overview:
- This recipe finder project is designed to assist users to easily, conveniently and quickly search for recipes alongside it's instructions and ingredients. I chose this project with the aim of solving the pressure and unease one may have due to limited recipe ideas and exactly how to prepare specific meals. It would help users get more confident and accurate with cooking. 

- Features and Functionality:
- The project has the input container that has a space for searching your recipes and within the same container, a magnifying-glass magnifier. After searching for a recipe, there is also a body container that displays the image of meal on the left as well as the instructions to the recipe of the meal on the right. Lastly, a section beneath the body container for ingredients display.

- Technologies Used:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript 

- Screenshots or Demo:
  - Include screenshots or a link to a live demo if available. Visual representations can help readers understand the project's appearance and functionality. 

- Roadmap and future enhancements:
  My future plans for this project is to add in more creativity and functionalities.
